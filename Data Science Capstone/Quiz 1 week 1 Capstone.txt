Pregunta 4
In the en_US twitter data set, if you divide the number of lines where the word "love" (all lowercase) occurs by the number of lines the word "hate" (all lowercase) occurs, about what do you get?

1 / 1 puntos

4

Correcto
\verb| grep "love" en_US.twitter | wc -l| grep "love" en_US.twitter wc−l∣ and

\verb| grep "hate" en_US.twitter | wc -l| grep "hate" en_US.twitter wc−l∣ gives you the counts. Then you could divide in whatever. If you never want to leave the console, you can use bc (not present on gitbash in windows). You could also read into R (\verb|readLines|readLines) and use character search.

This worked on gitbash

\verb| love=$(grep "love" en_US.twitter.txt | wc -l) |  love=$(grep "love" en_US.twitter.txt  wc−l)∣ then

\verb| hate=$(grep "hate" en_US.twitter.txt | wc -l) | hate=$(grep "hate" en_US.twitter.txt  wc−l)∣ then

\verb| let m=love/hate| let m=love/hate then

\verb| echo $m |  echo $m
