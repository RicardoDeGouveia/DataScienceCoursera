Pregunta 1
Consider the following data with x as the predictor and y as as the outcome.

x <- c(0.61, 0.93, 0.83, 0.35, 0.54, 0.16, 0.91, 0.62, 0.62)
y <- c(0.67, 0.84, 0.6, 0.18, 0.85, 0.47, 1.1, 0.65, 0.36)

Give a P-value for the two sided hypothesis test of whether \beta_{1} from a linear regression model is 0 or not.

Pregunta 3
In the \verb|mtcars|mtcars data set, fit a linear regression model of weight (predictor) on mpg (outcome). Get a 95% confidence interval for the expected mpg at the average weight. What is the lower endpoint?

Pregunta 4
Refer to the previous question. Read the help file for \verb|mtcars|mtcars. What is the weight coefficient interpreted as?

1 / 1 puntos

The estimated expected change in mpg per 1,000 lb increase in weight.

Correcto
This is the standard interpretation of a regression coefficient. The expected change in the response per unit change in the predictor.

Pregunta 5
Consider again the \verb|mtcars|mtcars data set and a linear regression model with mpg as predicted by weight (1,000 lbs). A new car is coming weighing 3000 pounds. Construct a 95% prediction interval for its mpg. What is the upper endpoint?

Pregunta 6
Consider again the \verb|mtcars|mtcars data set and a linear regression model with mpg as predicted by weight (in 1,000 lbs). A “short” ton is defined as 2,000 lbs. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the expected change in mpg per 1 short ton increase in weight. Give the lower endpoint.

Pregunta 7
If my X from a linear regression is measured in centimeters and I convert it to meters what would happen to the slope coefficient?

1 / 1 puntos

It would get multiplied by 100.

Correcto
It would get multiplied by 100.

Pregunta 8
I have an outcome, Y, and a predictor, X and fit a linear regression model with Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon to obtain \hat{\beta_{0}} and \hat{\beta_{1}}. What would be the consequence to the subsequent slope and intercept if I were to refit the model with a new regressor, X + cX+c for some constant, cc?

1 / 1 puntos

The new intercept would be \hat \beta_0 - c \hat \beta_1 

Correcto
This is exactly covered in the notes. But note that if Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon then Y = \beta_0 - c\beta_1 + \beta_1 (X + c) + \epsilon so that the answer is that the intercept gets subtracted by c\beta_{1}

9.
Pregunta 9
Refer back to the mtcars data set with mpg as an outcome and weight (wt) as the predictor. About what is the ratio of the the sum of the squared errors, \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat Y_i)^2 when comparing a model with just an intercept (denominator) to the model with the intercept and slope (numerator)?

0.25

Correcto
This is simply one minus the R^2 values

fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ 1, data = mtcars)
1 - summary(fit1)$r.squared
## [1] 0.2472
sse1 <- sum((predict(fit1) - mtcars$mpg)^2)
sse2 <- sum((predict(fit2) - mtcars$mpg)^2)
sse1/sse2
## [1] 0.2472

Pregunta 10
Do the residuals always have to sum to 0 in linear regression?

1 / 1 puntos

If an intercept is included, then they will sum to 0.

Correcto
They do provided an intercept is included. If not they most likely won't.
