Pregunta 2
Suppose that diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) for men aged 35-44 are normally distributed with a mean of 80 (mm Hg) and a standard deviation of 10. About what is the probability that a random 35-44 year old has a DBP less than 70?

Correcto

pnorm(70, mean = 80, sd = 10)

Pregunta 3
Brain volume for adult women is normally distributed with a mean of about 1,100 cc for women with a standard deviation of 75 cc. What brain volume represents the 95th percentile?

1 / 1 puntos

approximately 1223

Correcto
qnorm(0.95, mean = 1100, sd = 75)
## [1] 1223

Pregunta 4
Refer to the previous question. Brain volume for adult women is about 1,100 cc for women with a standard deviation of 75 cc. Consider the sample mean of 100 random adult women from this population. What is the 95th percentile of the distribution of that sample mean?

1 / 1 puntos

approximately 1112 cc

Correcto
qnorm(0.95, mean = 1100, sd = 75/sqrt(100))
[1] 1112

Pregunta 6
The respiratory disturbance index (RDI), a measure of sleep disturbance, for a specific population has a mean of 15 (sleep events per hour) and a standard deviation of 10. They are not normally distributed. Give your best estimate of the probability that a sample mean RDI of 100 people is between 14 and 16 events per hour?

1 / 1 puntos

68%

Correcto
The standard error of the mean is 10/\sqrt{100}=1. Thus between 14 and 16 is with one standard deviation of the mean of the distribution of the sample mean. Thus it should be about 68%.

pnorm(16, mean = 15, sd = 1) - pnorm(14, mean = 15, sd = 1)

Pregunta 7
Consider a standard uniform density. The mean for this density is .5 and the variance is 1 / 12. You sample 1,000 observations from this distribution and take the sample mean, what value would you expect it to be near?

1 / 1 puntos

0.5

Correcto
Via the LLN it should be near .5.

Poisson with a mean of 55 people per hour. You watch the bus

stop for 3 hours. About what's the probability of viewing 10 or fewer people?
