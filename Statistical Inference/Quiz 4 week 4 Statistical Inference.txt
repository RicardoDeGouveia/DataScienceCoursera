Pregunta 1
A pharmaceutical company is interested in testing a potential blood pressure lowering medication. Their first examination considers only subjects that received the medication at baseline then two weeks later. The data are as follows (SBP in mmHg)

Subject	   Baseline	Week 2
1		140	   132
2		138	   135
3		150	   151
4		148	   146
5		135	   130
Consider testing the hypothesis that there was a mean reduction in blood pressure? Give the P-value for the associated two sided T test.

(Hint, consider that the observations are paired.)

fu <- c(132, 135, 151, 146, 130)

Paired t-test
data: fu and bl
t = -2.262, df = 4, p-value = 0.08652
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0

Note the equivalence with this


t.test(fu - bl, alternative = "two.sided")

Pregunta 3
Researchers conducted a blind taste test of Coke versus Pepsi. Each of four people was asked which of two blinded drinks given in random order that they preferred. The data was such that 3 of the 4 people chose Coke. Assuming that this sample is representative, report a P-value for a test of the hypothesis that Coke is preferred to Pepsi using a one sided exact test.

Let p be the proportion of people who prefer Coke. Then, we want to test

H_0:p=.5 versus H_a:p>.5. Let X be the number out of 4 that prefer

Coke; assume X∼Binomial(p,.5).

Pvalue=P(X≥3)=choose(4,3)(0.5)^3(0.5)^1 + choose(4,4)(0.5)^4(0.5)^0

Pregunta 4
Infection rates at a hospital above 1 infection per 100 person days at risk are believed to be too high and are used as a benchmark. A hospital that had previously been above the benchmark recently had 10 infections over the last 1,787 person days at risk. About what is the one sided P-value for the relevant test of whether the hospital is *below* the standard?

Pregunta 5
Suppose that 18 obese subjects were randomized, 9 each, to a new diet pill and a placebo. Subjects’ body mass indices (BMIs) were measured at a baseline and again after having received the treatment or placebo for four weeks. The average difference from follow-up to the baseline (followup - baseline) was −3 kg/m2 for the treated group and 1 kg/m2 for the placebo group. The corresponding standard deviations of the differences was 1.5 kg/m2 for the treatment group and 1.8 kg/m2 for the placebo group. Does the change in BMI appear to differ between the treated and placebo groups? Assuming normality of the underlying data and a common population variance, give a pvalue for a two sided t test.

Pregunta 6
Brain volumes for 9 men yielded a 90% confidence interval of 1,077 cc to 1,123 cc. Would you reject in a two sided 5% hypothesis test of

H_0:μ=1,078?

1 / 1 puntos

No you wouldn't reject.

Correcto
No, you would fail to reject. The 95% interval would be wider than the 90% interval. Since 1,078 is in the narrower 90% interval, it would also be in the wider 95% interval. Thus, in either case it's in the interval and so you would fail to reject.

Pregunta 7
Researchers would like to conduct a study of 100100 healthy adults to detect a four year mean brain volume loss of .01~mm^3. Assume that the standard deviation of four year volume loss in this population is .04~mm^3. About what would be the power of the study for a 5\%5% one sided test versus a null hypothesis of no volume loss?

1 / 1 puntos

0.80

Correcto
The hypothesis is H_0 : \mu_\Delta =0 versus H_a : \mu_\Delta > 0 where \mu_\Delta is volume loss (change defined as Baseline - Four Weeks). The test statistics is 10 \frac{\bar X_\Delta}{.04}10 
which is rejected if it is larger than Z_{.95} = 1.645

We want to calculate

P\left(\frac{\bar X_\Delta}{\sigma_\Delta / 10} > 1.645 ~|~ \mu_\Delta = .01\right) = P\left( \frac{\bar X_\Delta - .01}{.004} > 1. 645 - \frac{.01}{.004} ~|~ \mu_\Delta = .01\right) = P(Z > −.855) = .80

Or note that \bar X_\Delta is N(.01, .004)N(.01,.004) under the alternative and we want the P(\bar X_\Delta > 1.645 * .004) under H_a


pnorm(1.645 * 0.004, mean = 0.01, sd = 0.004, lower.tail = FALSE)

Researchers would like to conduct a study of nn healthy adults to detect a four year mean brain volume loss of .01~mm^3. Assume that the standard deviation of four year volume loss in this population is .04~mm^3. About what would be the value of nn needed for 90% power of type one error rate of 5\%5% one sided test versus a null hypothesis of no volume loss?

140

Correcto
The hypothesis is H_0 : \mu_\Delta = 0 versus H_a : \mu_\Delta > 0H where \mu_\Deltaμ is volume loss (change defined as Baseline - Four Weeks). The test statistics is \frac{\bar X_\Delta}{.04 / \sqrt{n} } which is rejected if it is larger than Z_{.95} = 1.645Z 

We want to calculate

P\left(\frac{\bar X_\Delta}{\sigma_\Delta / \sqrt{n}} > 1.645 ~|~ \mu_\Delta = .01\right) = P\left( \frac{\bar X_\Delta - .01}{.04 / \sqrt{n}} > 1. 645 - \frac{.01}{.04 / \sqrt{n}} ~|~ \mu_\Delta = .01\right) = P(Z > 1.645 - \sqrt{n} / 4) = .90

So we need 1.645 - \sqrt{n} / 4 = Z_{.10} = -1.282 

and thus

n=(4∗(1.645+1.282))^2.

Pregunta 9
As you increase the type one error rate, \alphaα, what happens to power?

1 / 1 puntos

You will get larger power.

Correcto
As you require less evidence to reject, i.e. your \alphaα rate goes up, you will have larger power.
