1.Pregunta 1
R was developed by statisticians working at

1 / 1 puntos

The University of Auckland

Correcto
The R language was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman who were statisticians at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.


2.Pregunta 2
The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition? Select all that apply.

1 / 1 puntos

The freedom to prevent users from using the software for undesirable purposes.

Correcto
This is not part of the free software definition. Freedom 0 requires that the users of free software be free to use the software for any purpose.


The freedom to restrict access to the source code for the software.

Correcto
This is not part of the free software definition. Freedoms 1 and 3 require access to the source code.


The freedom to sell the software for any price.

Correcto
This is not part of the free software definition. The free software definition does not mention anything about selling software (although it does not disallow it).


3.Pregunta 3
In R the following are all atomic data types EXCEPT: (Select all that apply)

1 / 1 puntos

list

Correcto
'list' is not an atomic data type in R.


table

Correcto
'table' is not an atomic data type in R.

matrix

Correcto
'matrix' is not an atomic data type in R.

data frame

Correcto
'data frame' is not an atomic data type in R.

array

Correcto
'array' is not an atomic data type in R.

4.Pregunta 4
If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?

1 / 1 puntos

integer

Correcto
The 'L' suffix creates an integer vector as opposed to a numeric vector.


5.Pregunta 5
What is the class of the object defined by the expression x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)?

1 / 1 puntos

character

Correcto
The character class is the "lowest common denominator" here and so all elements will be coerced into that class.


6.Pregunta 6
If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression rbind(x, y)?

1 / 1 puntos

a matrix with two rows and three columns

Correcto
The 'rbind' function treats vectors as if they were rows of a matrix. It then takes those vectors and binds them together row-wise to create a matrix.


7.Pregunta 7
A key property of vectors in R is that

1 / 1 puntos

elements of a vector all must be of the same class

Correcto

8.Pregunta 8
Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[1]] give me? Select all that apply.

1 / 1 puntos

a numeric vector containing the element 2.

Correcto

a numeric vector of length 1.

Correcto

9.Pregunta 9
Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and y <- 2:3. What is produced by the expression x + y?

1 / 1 puntos

an integer vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7.

Correcto

10.Pregunta 10
Suppose I have a vector x <- c(3, 5, 1, 10, 12, 6) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are less than 6 to be equal to zero. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.

1 / 1 puntos

x[x %in% 1:5] <- 0

Correcto
You can create a logical vector with the expression x %in% 1:5 and then use the [ operator to subset the original vector x.

x[x < 6] <- 0

Correcto
You can create a logical vector with the expression x < 6 and then use the [ operator to subset the original vector x.

x[x <= 5] <- 0

Correcto
You can create a logical vector with the expression x <= 5 and then use the [ operator to subset the original vector x.


11.Pregunta 11
Use the Week 1 Quiz Data Set to answer questions 11-20.

In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?

1 / 1 puntos

Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, Temp, Month, Day

Correcto
You can get the column names of a data frame with the `names()' function.


12.Pregunta 12
Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

1 / 1 puntos

  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2

Correcto
You can extract the first two rows using the [ operator and an integer sequence to index the rows.


13.Pregunta 13
How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

1 / 1 puntos

153

Correcto
You can use the `nrows()' function to compute the number of rows in a data frame.


14.Pregunta 14
Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

1 / 1 puntos

    Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
152    18     131  8.0   76     9  29
153    20     223 11.5   68     9  30

Correcto
The `tail()' function is an easy way to extract the last few elements of an R object.


15.Pregunta 15
What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?

1 / 1 puntos

21

Correcto
The single bracket [ operator can be used to extract individual rows of a data frame.


16.Pregunta 16
How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?

1 / 1 puntos

37

Correcto
The `is.na' function can be used to test for missing values.


17.Pregunta 17
What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.

1 / 1 puntos

42.1

Correcto
The `mean' function can be used to calculate the mean.

Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?

1 / 1 puntos

212.8

Correcto
You need to construct a logical vector in R to match the question's requirements. Then use that logical vector to subset the data frame.
